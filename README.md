This repository contains the code and the plots that I use for some of my [LinkedIn posts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilio-l/recent-activity/shares/). Here are some posts that rely on data and others where I share my thoughts about data or related topics:

- We often talk as if we were at the verge of living in a digital *world*. But that’s far from the truth. [(link to post, which **relies on data**)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emilio-l_digital-ai-metaverse-activity-7074791555835842561-XIgJ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
